# plugin.video.flixgrabber
This plugin for Kodi provides a Netflix scraper and launches videos in Chrome.  Currently it only scrapes the main Netflix page.


Settings and language files adapted from https://github.com/andrewleech/plugin.video.netflixbmc

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
I have only tested this on Debian.  The only dependencies are Selenium and the Chrome driver so it might work on other platforms that support those.
</br>pip install selenium
</br>pip install chromedriver

<h2> Remote Control </h2>
I have been using the Kore app for Android as the remote control:  
The up and down buttons adjust the volume.  The left and right buttons go forward and back in the video.  The middle button is for pause/play and continues playback when the playback interrupter pops up.  The back/escape button exits playback.
